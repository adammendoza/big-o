Big O
=====

A big collection of data structures and algorithms puzzles that I have solved during the last few years.

All solutions are primarily in Java (under [java/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/java)). Some solutions are written Ruby (under [ruby/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/ruby)).

As on May 2013, the repository has roughly 130 problems with solutions.
Problem statements are specified as Javadoc at the top of every solution. I have tried to be as descriptive as I can, but if something is not clear then please do let me know!
Problems are broadly classified into the following categories which are self explanatory.

* [arrays/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/java/src/arrays)
* [binarytrees/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/java/src/binarytrees)
* [bitsandbytes/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/java/src/bitsandbytes)
* [cache/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/java/src/cache)
* [collections/](https://github.com/kowshik/big-o/tree/master/java/src/collections)
