Big O
=====

Big O is a big collection of data structures and algorithms puzzles that I have solved during leisure time. All solutions are primarily in Java (under java/). Some solutions are written Ruby (under ruby/).

As on May 2013, the repository has about 130 problems with solutions.
Problem statements are specified as Javadoc at the top of every solution. I have tried to be as descriptive as I can, but if something is not clear then please do let me know!
Problems are classified into the following categories which are self explanatory.

arrays/
binarytrees/
bitsandbytes/
cache/
collections/
concurrency/
dp/
general/
graphs/
sorting/
strings/
trees/
